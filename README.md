# Database

The dataset, [Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success), available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu), was collected from various databases at a higher education institution. It contains information on students enrolled in different undergraduate programs like agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, and more. The dataset includes details available at enrollment, such as academic background, demographics, socio-economic factors, and their academic performance after the first and second semesters. This data is used to develop models that predict student dropout and academic success. 

The classification problem involves three categories, with one class being significantly larger than the others, leading to class imbalance.

This dataset was developed as part of a project aimed at reducing academic dropout and failure rates in higher education. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to identify students at risk early in their academic journey, enabling timely intervention with support strategies. 

The task is framed as a three-class classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a student will drop out, remain enrolled, or graduate by the end of the standard course duration.

## Installation

The following installation instructions are provided for the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) operating system.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This has only been tested on [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/).


### Virtual Environment

The `python3-venv` package is required to create Python virtual environments. To install it on Ubuntu 22.04, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

### Getting the Project

Now, let's clone a Git repository and create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/bielaltoe/academic_success_classification

# Change into the project directory
cd academic_success_classification

# Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you are in the virtual environment, install the project's dependencies using `pip`. If you haven't installed it on your computer, simply run:


```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Then, you can proceed with installing the project dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Opening the project

To open the Jupyter Notebooks that contain the project, simply use the [JupyterLab computational environment](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) (which is already included as a dependency in this project). To run it, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

Then, open your browser at: http://localhost:8888/. The file [notebooks/academic_success_classifier](./notebooks/academic_success_classifier.ipynb) contains all the developed code for the project.


## Results

So, we noticed that the best models were **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** after dropping the `"Enrolled"` class. While some improvement was expected when using weighted models, the gains were not very significant. Ultimately, after reducing the problem to just two classes, the models performed well and appear suitable for the intended purpose.
